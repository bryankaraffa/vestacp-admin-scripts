# VestaCP Admin Scripts
##### Developed by Bryan Karaffa

These scripts are meant to automate common workflows for administrators that
use VestaCP.

## Requirements
 - Scripts are written in `bash` and must be run on Linux, OS X, or equivalent

 - You must have an account created in Vesta **with SSH Access** (`admin` account okay)
